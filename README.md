## Day 1 of 30-Day Map Challenge: Points

### 🗺️ Topic: Global Flood Affected People

![Imgur](/data/figs/1_points.png)

📊 Since I have been working on flood modeling for over a year, I wanted to start the map challenge with the flood topic. This map shows where people were reported to be affected by major flood events between 1985-2010. The most affected regions include the US (Dallas, Pennsylvania), South America (Brazil, Bolivia), Africa (Burkina Faso, Gao, Botswana), Asia (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh), and Australia. Moreover, people in coastal cities were observed to be more frequently affected than the rest.

✨Please feel free to give suggestions & share!

## Day 2 of 30-Day Map Challenge: Lines

### 🗺️ Topic: Global Shipping Routes ⛴️

The map shows the major, moderate, and minor shipping routes globally. I got inspiration from Prof. [Qiusheng Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giswqs/) paper in [JOSS](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03414) about the Python package [Leafmap](https://leafmap.org/) for these visualizations.
While making the map, I got obsessed with these two colors so including both of them here.

## Day 3 of 30-Day Map Challenge: Polygons

### 🗺️ Topic: Urbanization Trends in Lagos, Nigeria (1985-2018)

![d3](/data/figs/d3_polygons.png)

Mapping urbanization patterns always fascinates me. So, for the polygon theme, I used QGIS & #geemap, created a fishnet (~1 Km), and sampled the urban pixels in each zone.
The map reveals that Lagos city has experienced rapid urbanization, with the urban area growing exponentially over the past few decades, especially after 2000's era.

## Day 4 of 30-Day Map Challenge: Bad Map

## 🗺️ Topic: A bad map of prefecture-level divisions of China

![d4](/data/d4_badmap/d4_badmap.png)

It may be the easiest theme of the challenge, but always make sure to avoid such common mistakes in cartographic designs: 

1) Extra text is not always a good case! AVOID clusters of text, and use simple attribute labels where possible.

2) Unwanted colors: not all maps need colors, and sometimes unintentional use of colors can convey the wrong message. For instance, here, sequential choropleth colors are used based on ADM2 property, WHICH DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!

This is by far the most difficult day for me. Being a digital cartographer, I have only thought of making a map with a computer. For this day, I looked into previous year's challenges and loved how they used day-to-day things to create a map. I quickly looked around and saw some shining red beans in my kitchen, and the rest you can see 😂
