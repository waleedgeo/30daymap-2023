🗺️ Today's Map: Global Flood Affected People

📊 Since I have been working on flood modeling for over a year, I wanted to start the map challenge with the flood topic. This map shows where people were reported to be affected by major flood events between 1985-2010. The most affected regions include the US (Dallas, Pennsylvania), South America (Brazil, Bolivia), Africa (Burkina Faso, Gao, Botswana), Asia (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh), and Australia. Moreover, people in coastal cities were observed to be more frequently affected than the rest.

✨Please feel free to give suggestions & share!

The map shows the major, moderate, and minor shipping routes globally. I got inspiration from Prof. [Qiusheng Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giswqs/) paper in [JOSS](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03414) about the Python package [Leafmap](https://leafmap.org/) for these visualizations.
While making the map, I got obsessed with these two colors so including both of them here.

Day 3 of 30-Day Map Challenge: Polygons

🗺️ Topic: Urbanization Trends in Lagos, Nigeria (1985-2018)

![d3](/data/figs/d3_polygons.png)

Mapping urbanization patterns always fascinates me. So, for the polygon theme, I used QGIS & #geemap, created a fishnet (~1 Km), and sampled the urban pixels in each zone.
The map reveals that Lagos city has experienced rapid urbanization, with the urban area growing exponentially over the past few decades, especially after 2000's era.
